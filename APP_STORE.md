## Description
*(4000 characters max)*

**Snipbook is a camera-first junk journal for people who want to collect moments, not create masterpieces.**

Remember the joy of cutting photos with scissors and gluing them into a scrapbook? Snipbook brings that tactile, analog feeling to your phone—without the mess, without the pressure, and without the endless arranging.

**HOW IT WORKS**

1. Choose a shape (postage stamp, circle, ticket, label, torn paper, or rectangle)
2. Take a photo or pick one from your library
3. Watch as Snipbook automatically cuts your photo to fit the shape
4. Done. It's added to your book.

No cropping. No resizing. No filters. No arranging.

**YOUR SHAPES**

• Postage Stamp — Classic and nostalgic
• Circle — Clean and focused
• Ticket — For events and adventures
• Label — Tag your treasures
• Torn Paper — Perfectly imperfect
• Rectangle — Simple and versatile

**A BOOK THAT GROWS**

Your snips automatically fill pages in a simple, scrollable book. Each page holds one or two cut-outs, placed with just enough randomness to feel handmade. Watch your collection grow organically over time.

**WHAT MAKES SNIPBOOK DIFFERENT**

This is NOT a scrapbooking app. There are no templates, no stickers, no text tools, no layers to manage. Snipbook is intentionally simple.

• No accounts to create
• No social features
• No ads, ever
• No subscriptions
• No cloud uploads
• Works completely offline

**PERFECT FOR**

• Coffee cups and cozy moments
• Concert tickets and museum stubs
• Handwritten notes and receipts
• Food you made (or ate)
• Flowers, leaves, textures
• Anything that catches your eye

**PRIVACY FIRST**

Your photos never leave your device. We don't collect data, track usage, or require sign-in. Your moments are yours alone.

**EXPORT & SHARE**

When you're ready, export your book as a beautiful PDF to print, share, or archive.

Snipbook is for collectors, not creators. For keepers, not perfectionists. For people who know that the best memories are often the smallest ones.

Little moments, cut & kept.

## Review Notes for Apple

Snipbook is a simple photo journaling app that:
- Uses the camera to take photos
- Uses the photo library to import photos
- Masks photos to decorative shapes
- Stores everything locally on-device
- Does not require internet connectivity
- Does not collect any user data
- Has no in-app purchases
- Has no accounts or sign-in

The app requires camera and photo library permissions, which are requested at the appropriate time (when the user chooses to take or import a photo).
